    "1. **Python**: Python is one of the most popular programming languages used for data science. It has an ecosystem of libraries and frameworks such as `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch`, making it versatile for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.\n",
    "2. **R**: R is a statistical programming language that is widely used for data analysis and visualization. It has a strong community in the statistics and data science domains, and it's particularly popular in academia.\n",
    "3. **Java**: Java is used in big data processing and analytics, especially with Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. It's known for its scalability and performance.\n",
    "4. **SQL**: Structured Query Language (*SQL*) is essential for working with relational databases. Data scientists often use SQL to query databases and extract relevant information for analysis.\n",
    "5. **Julia**: Julia is gaining popularity in the data science community for its performance in numerical and scientific computing. It's designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for data-intensive tasks.\n",
    "6. **Scala**: Scala is a programming language that is compatible with Java and often used in conjunction with Apache Spark for distributed data processing."
